- 👋 Hola, I’m @bgn79 according to acronymfinder.com/Begin-(BGN).html BGN stands for Begin and that is my moniker, 79 is the year of my birth, thus @bgn79 has been my handle online since 2000. You can call me Begin, B G N, Beige, Bee Gee but use my middle name when reffering to me by my government.
- 👀 I’m interested in putting my moniker on various surfaces, boxcar being my favorite, highly visible locations in highly trafficked areas is another. Documenting the process of said acts along with others vandalism for publication in various forms of media. DVD, www, Instagram, IG Reels, Flickr(kinda a thing of the past), Tumblr, YouTube.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create perfect WordPress theme for war42.org, teaching myself JS, CSS and whatever else need to do so.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating the best graffiti website ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
